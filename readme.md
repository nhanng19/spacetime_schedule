BootCamp Homework - 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler
## The Challenge
Our client request us to create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. We'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## User Story

```
AS AN employee with a busy schedule
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
``` 

## The Process
To satisfy our client's needs, we had to:
- Creat an HTML file that imports JS Moment library, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript
- Add CSS elements to make the quiz's theme purple
- Create two JavaScript files (one containing functions to execute the quiz and one to store previous scores)
- Modify HTML file to dynamically work with JavaScript file

HTML File

```

```

CSS File

```

```
Specific functions in JavaScript file

```

```

Specific functions in Highscore JavaScript file

```

```
## The Result
After modifying the JavaSript file, we were able to provide a secure, clean, and fully functional password generator for our client.
